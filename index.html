        <h2>Phase I: Main Concept</h2>

        <p>The course is designed to familiarize student with the basics of programming before starting the javascript section.  You learn the foundamentals of web design and complete exercises to make sure that you have enough
            familiarity with good programming technics.</p>


        <p>This three series section is a stand-alone introduction to computer programming.  It is designed for someone with no previous exposure to programming to get some practice and to learn some basics.  The goal of the exercises 
            is to give you practice with web development concepts and to help diagnose your level of programming ability.</p>

        <p>Some of the later problem sets are much longer than the earlier ones, because we need the concepts in the earlier sections before we can really write many interesting programs. So, donâ€™t be misled by the short length of 
            the early problem sets.</p>
